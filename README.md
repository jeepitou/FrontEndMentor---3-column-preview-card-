## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to use min-width and max-width, which really improved the way it looked overall. I also learned that I should be designing for mobile first.

### Continued development

I need to keep doing these, I always face some CSS bug that I manage to fix but without really knowing why it wasn't working in the first place.
